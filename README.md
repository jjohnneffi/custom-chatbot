This project is a chatbot implementation using Google Gemini AI in Python. It allows users to have a continuous conversation with the chatbot, where each interaction (user input and chatbot response) is stored in the conversation history. The chatbot uses a pre-uploaded text file (chatbot.txt) for context, making it capable of answering domain-specific questions. The chat runs in a loop until the user exits, and Google Generative AI's streaming response ensures real-time replies. Safety settings are applied to filter harmful content
